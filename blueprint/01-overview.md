01 — Website Blueprint Overview
Purpose of This Blueprint

This blueprint is a reusable, system-level template for generating fully branded, fully structured websites for any future client or internal brand. It converts the workflow used to build the ProSynth website into a standardized blueprint that can be replicated using:

Cline (PLAN + ACT workflow)

Codex (precision UI/UX editing)

Custom GPT – Brand Customization Pass (brand-specific adaptation)

GitHub + VS Code (version control + local development)

What This Blueprint Enables

By following this blueprint, you can:

✓ Rebuild any website using the exact structure used for ProSynth
✓ Swap branding, content, assets, color schemes, and typography with zero guesswork
✓ Maintain identical UI/UX flow across all brands
✓ Ensure all generated sites remain consistent, clean, scalable, and technically correct
✓ Run the same workflows across DejaVu, ProSynth, Catalyst, or future client brands
✓ Allow Cline to regenerate any website with near-zero structural error
