Website Blueprint — Master Repository

A universal, brand-agnostic website generation framework for ProSynth, DejaVu, Catalist, and all client projects.

🚀 Purpose of This Blueprint

This repository contains the official Website Blueprint used to generate:

The ProSynth website

The DejaVu website

Future client websites

Any new brand under your ecosystem

It provides:

A complete file architecture

Fully reusable HTML/CSS/JS structure

Cline Plan + Act prompts

Codex editing guidelines

A brand customization system

A stable versioning model

A logic map for ROI calculator + packages

A fix library for rapid troubleshooting

This Blueprint ensures every website you build follows:

The same layout

The same file structure

The same logic

The same automation-ready patterns

It guarantees:

✔️ Repeatable
✔️ Scalable
✔️ Ultra-fast to customize
✔️ Zero guesswork
✔️ Compatible with Cline/Codex and your custom GPT

🧠 How This Blueprint Is Used

You can generate a full new website in 3 steps:

STEP 1 — Brand Customization GPT

Feed the system:

Brand summary

Brand assets

Relevant SOPs

Required positioning

It outputs:

Brand-aligned copy

Section-by-section replacements

Required modifications to the base structure

ROI calculator adjustments (if needed)

Package card modifications

Any required layout tweaks

This is the thinking stage.

STEP 2 — Cline (PLAN + ACT)
PLAN Mode

Paste the file:

03-cline-plan-prompt.md

Cline will:

Analyze the Blueprint

Understand file structure

Understand constraints

Prepare a step-by-step implementation plan

ACT Mode

Paste brand-generated output and let Cline:

Rewrite files in /src

Update logo paths

Replace copy text

Update styles

Inject correct ROI logic

Maintain layout perfectly

This is the building stage.

STEP 3 — Codex Refinement

Use Codex for:

Precision spacing

Typography tweaks

Alignment fixes

Mobile responsiveness fixes

Color corrections

Path adjustments

Logic debugging

This is the polish stage.

🧩 Core Principles of the Blueprint
1. Layout Is Sacred

The structure from DejaVu → ProSynth → future brands must be preserved 1:1.

Sections can be updated, never restructured.

2. File Names Must Never Change

All logic depends on:

index.html  
style.css  
main.js  
roi-calculator.js  
tierLogic.js  
package-card.js  
copy-library.json  


Renaming a file is a MAJOR version update.

3. Assets Live in Predictable Folders

Never change:

/assets/logos
/assets/images
/assets/icons

4. ROI Calculator Must Stay Compatible

Logic can be updated (MINOR), but structure must remain.

5. Everything Must Be Documented

Any update must follow the versioning rules:

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

🧰 Included Systems
Cline Plan System

A full system prompt describing repository structure, file dependencies, and rules.

Cline Act System

Instructions for safe rewriting without breaking layouts.

Codex Editing Framework

Exact patterns for how Codex performs precision edits.

Brand Customization Pass

Transforms any website into the style and personality of a brand without changing architecture.

ROI Logic Map

Explains pricing logic, value generation, and tier calculations.

Common Fix Library

Instant repair tools for:

broken images

broken layouts

missing JS imports

incorrect paths

spacing collapses

mobile responsiveness

Versioning System

Ensures updates are safe, controlled, predictable.

🔄 How a Full Website Build Works (Simple Version)
1. Duplicate this Blueprint repo
2. Gather brand information + assets
3. Run Brand Customization GPT
4. Feed output into Cline (PLAN → ACT)
5. Use Codex for precision fixes
6. Push final changes to GitHub
7. Deploy to Netlify / Vercel / Cloudflare


Every build follows the same steps.
